This repo is a tool/spec. It’s also an argument: prompts should be treated like artifacts.

Below is a short, annotated bibliography of adjacent ideas. (We’ll keep it small and useful.)

## Compiler / IR thinking
- **Intermediate representations** (compilers)
  - Why: RPO is “prompt IR” with multiple render targets.

## Testing as contract
- **Snapshot / golden file testing**
  - Why: the rendered prompt is the contract; snapshots prevent accidental drift.

## Context management
- **Working memory vs long-term memory** (general cognitive / systems framing)
  - Why: RPO’s warm state is explicitly a small, maintained working summary.

## TODO
Add a small set of concrete links (papers/posts/docs) that directly justify:
- structured prompting
- deterministic rendering
- eval/snapshot discipline
